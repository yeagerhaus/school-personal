Hello!

My name is Cole Yeager, and this is my Personal Repository that I created so I can store personal projects, ideas, and programs/files that I'm working on.  The main use for this Repo is learning new programming languages and frameworks so I can be a more skilled Developer.  Feel free to poke around!
